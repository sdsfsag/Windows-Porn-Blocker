# Performance Requirements for Porn Blocker 3.5 and higher

The new version of the Porn Blocker includes a **background timer** and a **real-time website monitoring feature**. This may cause performance issues on **very old or weaker PCs**.

*Please note that the instructions apply to version 3.5. If your PC doesn't support these requirements, just stay on the 3.4 version, which is still available. It can't do as much as the 3.5, but it also saves performance.*
