# Porn  

Welcome to my software, here I'll tell you what it does.
## Functions
- It has a built-in blocker that blocks porn sites as well as sex game sites.
- Feedback function to send feedback
- Support if you need help
- It supports English and German
- Version check function where you cam check if your version is old or up to date!
- Built-in info function that provides even more information about the blocker.

- ## Porn Blocker PV
- PV stands for “Parent Version” and helps parents protect their children from 18+ videos and apps.
- There is a feature called "Strict Block" that also blocks sites and apps, such as c.ai, that can be exploited for false purposes.
- Parents can send a secret version of Porn Blocker to their child's computer from their computer without the child noticing.
- At the moment it's not worth downloading the parent version because there were only 4 versions in which only more pages were added. At the moment not all functions work as they should, but that will change at the beginning of summer 2025, as you can read [here](https://github.com/sdsfsag/Windows-Porn-Blocker/blob/main/Important%20information).

## How does it work?
- It writes every site + a second version of the site + its IP address, then it writes 2 firewall rules for each site, so that nothing from such sites gets to your computer and nothing from your computer gets to such sites, which requires administrator rights, so don't be surprised if the UAC screen pops up. This may cause Windows Defender or your antivirus program to say that Porn Blocker is a virus. This double site + IP + double firewall roule is for 5 times better security!

## Help
- If you need help, you can use the built in Support function.
- If you want to send some feedback, you can use the built in feedback function.

## Information
- The Porn Blocker will come to its final release in the next Summer 2025. From then on there will probably be no more updates and we will no longer care about the blocker. Everything will be discontinued except the support and feedback function.
- Use the “Version Check” function every few weeks to check whether you are still on the current version or whether your version is already out of date.
